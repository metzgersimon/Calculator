# Calculator
This project was my first project written in python. The intention of this project was to get started with python and to do this in a cool way. 
Therefore I decided to program a GUI calculator using tkinter.


### What I have learned
- basic python syntax
- how to set up a simple GUI using tkinter
- add several widgets to the GUI and customize those

### Possible improvements
- add more functionality to the calculator (squareroot, power,...)
- reorganize the project with different classes
- enhance the appearance
